*********************** Testing model on independent datasets ****************************************

For executing the model testing scripts, please download the following:
    a) blmpred5to60.npy.gz -> Pre-generated ProtTrans embeddings for BLMPred_5to60 dataset from the link 
    https://drive.google.com/file/d/18QQJyNyxisQWPItd559iTRo9q-PexJn0/view?usp=share_link
    b) blmpred8to25.npy.gz -> Pre-generated ProtTrans embeddings for BLMPred_8to25 dataset from the link
    https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cGBG1ikeStQiz_79NysnCpxg7D7fgTR9/view?usp=share_link
    c) blmpred_5to60.sav.gz -> Trained BLMPred_5to60 model from the link
    https://drive.google.com/file/d/14_rVBkX3GBjEm31NZVrhkocw1PBnN8s8/view?usp=sharing
    d) blmpred_8to25.sav.gz -> Trained BLMPred_8to25 model from the link
    https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dMES36vgPx4IGVbubdTIc2dxMD0R7NoE/view?usp=sharing

After downloading the models and the embeddings, please unzip them by using the following commands:
    a) gunzip blmpred5to60.npy.gz
    b) gunzip blmpred8to25.npy.gz
    c) gunzip blmpred_5to60.sav.gz
    d) gunzip blmpred_8to25.sav.gzs

** Please note that GPU along with recent CUDA version and NVIDIA driver pairs are needed to execute the model testing scripts.
Please use Conda environment 'rapids' for executing the scripts with RAPIDS package. 

1) blmpred_5to60.py -> Script for testing BLMPred_5to60 model on the independent BLMPred_5to60_test dataset. This script will generate the performance metrics and the confusion matrix as output.

2) blmpred_8to25.py -> Script for testing BLMPred_8to25 model on the independent BLMPred_8to25_test dataset. This script will generate the performance metrics and the confusion matrix as output.

*********************** Testing model on user-provided datasets ****************************************

If the users want to make predictions on their own dataset, then please follow the steps below:
1) Place your data in a .csv file following the format of [peptide length, peptide sequence].
2) Go to 'Embeddings' folder and execute 1_csv_to_fasta.py, 2_create_embeddings.py, and 4_process_embeddings.py.
3) Execute make_predictions.py for generating predictions on your dataset which will be stored in a file 'predictions.csv' [peptide id, Epitope/Non-epitope].
    3.1) 1st user-input -> Filename storing embeddings on line 5.
    3.2) 2nd user-input -> Load either BLMPred_5to60 or BLMPred_8to25 model on line 8.
