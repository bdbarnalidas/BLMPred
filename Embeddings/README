1) protT5 -> ProtT5-XL-UniRef50 (also ProtT5-XL-U50) model of ProtTrans embedder downloaded from Rostlab (https://github.com/Rostlab/ProtTrans).

2) 1_csv_to_fasta.py -> Converts csv file to fasta format which is needed by the embedder.
    2.1) 1st user-input -> Input file path on line 1.
    2.2) 2nd user-input -> Output file path on line 2.

3) 2_create_embeddings.py -> Generate ProtTrans embeddings in a binary file (.h5 file).
    3.1) 1st user-input -> Input file path on line 8.
    3.2) 2nd user-input -> Output file path on line 19.

4) 3_merge_embeddings.py -> Merge epitope embeddings and non-epitope embeddings into a single numpy array.
                            Also converts .h5 file to .npy file (binary data to numpy array required for ML in next step).
    3.1) 1st user-input -> Filename with epitope embeddings on line 5.
    3.2) 2nd user-input -> Filename with non-epitope embeddings on line 6.
    3.3) 3rd user-input -> Output file name on line 7.
    3.4) 4th user-input -> Specify number of epitopes on line 9.
    3.5) 5th user-input -> Specify number of non-epitopes on line 10.
