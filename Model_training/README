For executing the model training scripts, please download the following:
    a) blmpred5to60.npy.gz -> Pre-generated ProtTrans embeddings for BLMPred_5to60 dataset from the link 
    https://drive.google.com/file/d/18QQJyNyxisQWPItd559iTRo9q-PexJn0/view?usp=share_link
    b) blmpred8to25.npy.gz -> Pre-generated ProtTrans embeddings for BLMPred_8to25 dataset from the link
    https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cGBG1ikeStQiz_79NysnCpxg7D7fgTR9/view?usp=share_link

After downloading these embeddings, please unzip them by using the following commands:
    a) gunzip blmpred5to60.npy.gz
    b) gunzip blmpred8to25.npy.gz

** Please note that GPU along with recent CUDA version and NVIDIA driver pairs are needed to execute the model training scripts.
Please use Conda environment 'rapids' for executing SVM with RAPIDS.
